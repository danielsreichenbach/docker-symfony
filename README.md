# Drone build container for the Symfony2 development framework

A build container intended for running builds for the [Symfony2][symfony]
framework using the [Drone][drone] continuous integration platform.

The image is based on [Alpine Linux][alpine] version 3.2, and builds upon their
[minimal docker image][docker-alpine].

## Features

The container provides `nginx`, command line `php` and the `php-fpm` daemon,
along with the following PHP modules:

* bcmath
* ctype
* ctype
* curl
* json
* mcrypt
* mysql
* opcache
* openssl
* pdo
* pdo_mysql
* pdo_sqlite
* sqlite3
* zlib

In addition [Composer][composer] is available to bootstrap your [Symfony2][symfony]
applications.

## Usage

This container is intended to be used as build image in Drone, as shown in
the following example:

```yaml
build:
  image: danielsreichenbach/symfony:1.0
  commands:
    - composer install
```

## Known issues

Currently it is not possible to run [PhantomJS][phantomjs] inside Alpine based
containers due to there being no build compatible with Alpine's musl libc.

:cry:
